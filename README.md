# Journey of the Soul

## Created during Global Game Jam 2019

A game about making your way in a fantastic realm with your family.  Explore the wilds, encounter fantastic beasts, and meet new friends along the way.

In reality, more of an engine - locations (among other things) are defined in JSON files, enabling intense customization

Made entirely in Godot engine, using computers running various Linux distributions - as open source as a game can be.

I think one of us has a proprietary wifi driver, but that's about it for non-open software.

In addition, I planned to use Aseprite, though we ran out of time and decided to go assetless - this isn't surprising, as all main contributors were working with Godot for the first or nearly the first time (One of us had played with it, but only made a rendering toy), and we basically decided to make an RPG (why do we do this to ourselves?).
